### 🚀 Projects

**ML-Based Intrusion Detection System**

• Built a machine learning-based intrusion detection system to analyze network and system logs for anomalous activity.
• Performed data preprocessing and feature engineering to prepare security logs for model training.
• Applied anomaly detection techniques to identify suspicious patterns while reducing noise in log data.
• Supported security analysis by enabling early identification of abnormal network behavior.

---

**AI-Based Security Log Analyzer (RAG + Vector Search)**

• Developed an AI-powered security log analysis system to intelligently analyze and query large-scale system and security logs.
• Implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using sentence embeddings and FAISS-based vector search for efficient log
retrieval.
• Designed log ingestion, preprocessing, chunking, and embedding workflows to handle high-volume unstructured log data.
• Enabled natural language querying over logs to detect anomalies, suspicious activities, and security insights.
• Improved log investigation efficiency by automating manual log inspection and pattern identification tasks.


---

**AI-Based Legal Document Summarizer (RAG + LLM)**

• Developed an AI-based system to analyze multi-page legal documents and extract executive summaries, key risks, and contractual obligations.
• Implemented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using vector embeddings and similarity search to improve context-aware
clauseunderstanding.
• Designed document ingestion, chunking, embedding, and querying pipelines to handle structured and unstructured legal text.
• Enabled faster document review by automating manual summarization and risk identification tasks.
